# Geometric Shapes
**Geometric Shapes** is a program, with which you can create **rectangles** and **circles**.

You can specify the **coordinates** where the shapes should be in a fixed coordinate system. 
Further their characteristics will be calculated and the shapes will be **drawn** according to their characteristics.

## Usage
1. You can select from a number of available commands:
> "New rectangle" - create new rectangle\
> "New circle" - create new circle\
> "Quit" - quit program

2. The coordinates have to be set
> First point:  x coordinate: __\
> First point:  y coordinate: __\
> Second point: x coordinate: __\
> Second point: y coordinate: __

3. Characteristics will be calculated and shown
> Width:\
> Height:\
> Area:
