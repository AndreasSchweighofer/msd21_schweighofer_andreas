# Hello
This is my first exercise writing Markdown.

I am really motivated to learn more about properly making README-files and using markdown.

## Comment
I do find [this link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Cheatsheet") really useful.

As well as [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com).
